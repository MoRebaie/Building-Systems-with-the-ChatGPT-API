# Building-Systems-with-the-ChatGPT-API
This repo includes notebooks on how to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model, find prompt chains that build on previous responses, integrate systems with Python code, build a customer service chatbot, and explore capabilities like classifying user queries, evaluating safety, and multi-step reasoning. It's taken from the "Building Systems with the ChatGPT API" short course by DeepLearning.AI.
